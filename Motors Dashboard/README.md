# Motors Dashboard
MotorDashboard is an embedded systems project that provides full control over DC motors, servos, and stepper motors. This project allows you to control the angle, direction, and speed of these motors using a keypad, LCD display, timers, and external interrupts. Whether you're working on robotics projects, automation systems, or any application that involves motor control, MotorDashboard simplifies the process and provides a user-friendly interface.  
## Features
- DC Motor Control: Precisely control the direction and speed of DC motors.
- Servo Motor Control: Set the angle of servo motors with ease.
- Stepper Motor Control: Control stepper motors for precise and controlled rotation.
- User Interface: Utilize a keypad for input and an LCD display for real-time feedback.
- Timers: Use timers for accurate timing and control.
- External Interrupts: Implement external interrupts for responsive motor control.
- Configurable Settings: Customize parameters such as motor speed, step size, and interrupt triggers.
## Usage
MotorDashboard provides a user-friendly interface for controlling motors. Here's a brief overview of how to use it:
- Power On: Power up your embedded system.
- LCD Display: The LCD display will show the current status and instructions for motor control.
- Keypad Input: Use the keypad to input commands such as motor selection, direction, speed, or angle (for servos). Follow on-screen prompts.
- Real-time Feedback: The LCD display will provide real-time feedback on motor status, direction, and angle.
- Interrupts and Timers: Utilize external interrupts and timers for advanced motor control, if needed.
- Customization: Modify the code to adjust parameters like motor speed, step size, or interrupt triggers according to your project requirements.
